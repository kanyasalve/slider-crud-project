1️⃣ How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add with more time?

I spent approximately 1–2 hours completing the coding test, including backend CRUD setup, frontend slider integration, and responsive design adjustments.
2️⃣ How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you done this before?

To track down a performance issue in production, I would:

Check server logs and error logs

Monitor database queries (slow query log)

Use browser developer tools (Network & Performance tab)

Analyze API response times

Profile backend execution time

Use monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, or server metrics)

Yes, I have investigated performance issues before, mainly related to slow database queries and unoptimized loops. I resolved them by adding indexing, optimizing queries, and reducing unnecessary processing.
